An object, on the other hand can be a data structure, but also any other variable or a function.

So, in summary, shallow copying an object won't create objects that are independent clones, i.e., the copy is not fully independent of the original. A deep copy of an object will recursively clone \"child\" objects (like nested parts of a list). The clone is fully independent of the original, but creating a deep copy is slower, as it involves assigning new memory space. Keep in mind that this shallow vs. deep copy business does  not just apply to lists. You can copy arbitrary objects (including custom classes) with the copy module.\n",

    "**Why Python \"shallow\" copies objects:** This is a bit of a technical detail, but important to keep in mind: Python does shallow copying of mutable objects for (computing) performance considerations. By not copying the underlying object when you re-assign a mutable object to a new (\"variable\") name, Python avoids unnecessary memory usage. This is known as \"passing by reference\" (in contrast to passing by \"value\", where a new variable would be actually created in memory). That does not change the fact that shallow vs. deep copying can be confusing, of course!\n",

    "\n",
    "Open `align_seqs.py` from TheMulQuaBio's code directory. This script aligns two DNA sequences such that they are as similar as possible. Run the script and make sure you understand what every line is doing. A good way to do this, now that you have learnt debugging, is to insert a breakpoint (`import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`) at key locations in the script and examine what is going on. For example, inserting one just after the start of the `for` loop of the `calculate_score` function/module is a good place.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The aligning algorithm is simple. Start by positioning the beginning of the shorter sequence at all positions (bases) of the longer one (the start position), and count the number of bases matched downstream. Then, for each start position, count the \"score\" as total of number of bases matched. The alignment with the highest score wins. Ties are possible, in which case, you just take the an arbitrary alignment (e.g., first or last) with the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert `align_seqs.py` to a Python program that takes the DNA sequences as an input from a single external file and saves the best alignment along with its corresponding score in a single text file (your choice of format and file type) to an appropriate location. No external input should be required; that is, you should still only need to use `python align_seq.py` to run it.\n",
    "    For example, the input file can be a single `.csv` file with the two example sequences given at the top of the original script.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Groupwork Practical on Align DNA sequences \n",
    "\n",
    "Align all the `.fasta` sequences from the [Unix chapter](./01-Unix.ipynb). Call the new script `align_seqs_fasta.py`. Unlike `align_seqs.py`, this script should take *any* two fasta sequences (in separate files) to be aligned as input. So this script would typically run by using explicit inputs, for example, when called with something like: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 align_seqs_fasta.py seq1.fasta seq2.fasta\n",

    "* Modify your doctests approriately, and  modify your script such that it can handle cases where there is a typo (such as 'Quercuss') or there is a genus name that is not strictly 'Quercus'. \n",
