    "Here we are going to learn about the UNIX operating system, and in particular, it's most popular user-friendly avatar, Linux (and even more specifically, Debian based Linux distributions, with focus on Ubuntu). If you are not a Unix/Linux user, you still need to learn the UNIX environment because under the hood, all other operating systems that need to do *serious* computing have to use Unix. Indeed, MacOS is built on UNIX, and Windows now a days has a UNIX sub-system to enable users to things that can only really be done in UNIX (like Genomics!). "

    "UNIX is a machine-independent operating system (OS) developed in the 1970s by AT&T programmers (notably Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, fathers of `C`) for programmers (you!). It is multi-user and network-oriented by design, uses plain text files for storing data (no proprietary file formats), and has a strictly hierarchical directory structure (more on this below). This makes it an ideal environment for developing your code and storing your data.\n",
