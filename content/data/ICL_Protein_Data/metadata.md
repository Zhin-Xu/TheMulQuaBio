Collated data from one of the other BCM practicals in 2017; 

Each row is a lab-partner pair, and the three columns are their estimates of the concentration of ovalbumin in an analyte (mg mL-1) using three different protein estimation techniques - UV (absorbance at 280 nm o tryptophan/tyrosine), Bradford (binding of lysine/arginine to Coomassie blue dye), and biuret (complexation of the peptide backbone to copper ions). The Bradford and biuret tests were calibrated using BSA, which is unusually rich in arginine, so the analyte ovalbumin is badly underestimated, as you can see if you boxplot the data. The UV data were converted to a concentration using a formula based on 'average' amino acid compositions: ovalbumin seems a bit deficient in tryptophan/tyrosine compared to this 'average' protein.
