    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In your research, you will produce papers, reports and&mdash;very importantly&mdash;your thesis. These documents can be written using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor (e.g., Word). However, an alternative especially suited for scientific publications is LaTeX. In LaTeX, the document is written  in a text file (`.tex`) with certain typesetting (tex) syntax. Text formatting is done using markups (like HTML). The file is then \"compiled\" (like source code of a programming language) into a file &ndash; typically in PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why $\\LaTeX$?\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The input is a small, portable text file\n",
    "* LaTeX compilers are freely available for all OS'\n",
    "* Exactly the same result on any computer (not true for Word, for example)\n",
    "* LaTeX produces beautiful, professional looking docs\n",
    "* Images are easy to embed and annotate \n",
    "* Mathematical formulas (esp complex ones) are easy to write\n",
    "* LaTeX is very stable &ndash; current version basically same since 1994! (9 major versions of MS Word since 1994 &ndash; with compatibility issues)\n",
    "* LaTeX is free!\n",
    "* You can focus on content, and not worry so much about formatting while writing \n",
    "* An increasing number of Biology journals provide $\\LaTeX$ templates, making formatting quicker. \n",
    "* Referencing (bibliography) is easy (and can also be version controlled) and works with tools like Mendeley and Zotero\n",
    "* Plenty of online support available &ndash; your question has probably already been answered\n",
    "* You can integrate LaTeX into a workflow to auto-generate lengthy and complex documents (like your thesis).\n",

    "**LaTeX documents scale up better then WYSIWYG editors.** Latex files for really large and complex documents (such as PhD Theses) are much easier to edit, manage and publish in specific formats (like pdf) than Word or Open Office documents.\n",

    "\n",
    "* It has a steeper learning curve.\n",
    "* Can be difficult to manage revisions with multiple authors &ndash; especially if they don't use LaTeX! (Cue: Windows on a virtual machine!)\n",
    "* Tracking changes are not available out of the box (but can be enabled using a suitable package) \n",
    "* Typesetting tables can be a bit complex.\n",
    "* Images and floats are easy to embed, and won't jump around like Word, but if you don't use the right package, they can be difficult to place where you want!"

    "## Key $\\LaTeX$ features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are used to format blocks of text or graphics in a Latex document. They are delimited by an opening `\\begin` and a closing `\\end` tags (except for certain math environments). Everything inside will be formatted in a specific manner depending on the type of environment. For example, the code \n",
    "\n",
    "```latex\n",
    "\\begin{center}\n",
    "    Here is some text\n",
    "\\end{center}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will produce \"Here is some text\" centered in the middle of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used Latex environments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Environment| Purpose|\n",
    "|:-|:-|\n",
    "|`\\begin{center} ... \\end{center}`| Center the elements (works for text as well as graphics) |\n",
    "|`\\begin{itemize} ... \\end{itemize}`| An itemized list  (default is bullet points)|\n",
    "|`\\begin{enumerate} ... \\end{enumerate}`| An enumerated list (default is Arabic numerals) |\n",
    "|`\\begin{figure} ... \\end{figure}`| For displaying a Figure |\n",
    "|`\\begin{table} ... \\end{table}`| For displaying a table |\n",
    "|`\\( ... \\)`, `$ ... $`, or `\\begin{math}...\\end{math}`| For displaying an equation inline (as part of a sentence) |\n",
    "|`\\[ ... \\]`, `$$ ... $$`, or `\\begin{displaymath}...\\end{displaymath}`| For producing an equation as a separate, display item (separate from the text)|\n",
    "|`\\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation}`| For displaying a centered, numbered equation as a separate, display item|\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these environments, you can use modifier directives to the environment to tailor them. For example, in the `itemize` environment, the default is to create a list with bullets, but you can pick any symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below in your first Latex document example, you will see some examples of environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Some characters are \"special\" in Latex. These characters have a specific purpose, either inside a particular environment (e.g., table or equation), or both outside and inside an environment.    \n",
    "\n",
    "|Character| What it does|\n",
    "|:-|:-|\n",
    "|`#`| Used to reference arguments for a latex command; similar to the way `$` is an argument reference in [shell scripts](02-ShellScripting-Variables) |\n",
    "|`$`| Used for opening or closing a mathematical equation or symbol; e.g.,`$y = mx + c$` gives $$y = mx + c$$|\n",
    "|`%` | Comment character; everything from this symbol up to the end of line is ignored and will not appear in the final document |\n",
    "|`&`| Alignment character; used to align columns in tables, and also equations in math environments|\n",
    "|`_`| Subscript in math environments|\n",
    "|`^`| Superscript in math environments|\n",
    "|`{` and `}`| Use to group characters in math environments, and to enclose arguments in Latex commands|\n",
    "|`~`| (equivalent to the command `\\nobreakspace{}`) An \"unbreakable\" space, which can be used to add one or more \"hard\" spaces inside as well as outside math environments; for example, `$x  y$` gives $$x  y$$, but `$x~~y$` gives $$x~~y$$|\n",
    "|`\\`|  Indicates a LaTeX command, as in `\\LaTeX` or `\\maketitle` (or can be used to escape as special character - see below)|\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rendering special characters \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to actually reproduce these special characters in your document, you have to \"escape\" them by adding a *backslash* (`\\`) in front of them. For example, writing `$\\%$` produces the actual percentage symbol, $\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latex commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Every LaTeX command starts with a `\\` . There are two types of commands: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Commands without arguments**: These commands are standalone, and do not take any additional arguments.\n",
    "    * For example, in your first latex document above, the `\\maketitle` command tells latex to render the title in the typeset document. \n",
    "    * Another example: to render $\\LaTeX$, you need the command `\\LaTeX`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Commands with arguments**: These commands can (and often must) take arguments with curly brackets, which can be modified by including additional directives in square brackets before the main argument.\n",
    "    * For example, in your first latex example above, the `\\documentclass[12pt]{article}`\n",
    "    * Another example: `\\date{}` inserts the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spaces and new lines \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Several spaces in your text editor are treated as one space in the typeset document\n",
    "* Several empty lines are treated as one empty line\n",
    "* One empty line defines a new paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typesetting math\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to display math\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inline (i.e., within the text).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stand-alone, numbered equations and formulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "For inline math, the \"dollar\" sign flanks the math to be typeset. For example, the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$\\int_0^1 p^x (1-p)^y dp$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes $\\int_0^1 p^x (1-p)^y dp$\n",
    "\n",
    "For numbered equations, LaTeX provides the `equation` environment. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\int_0^1 \\left(\\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \n",
    "    \\right)^y dx = y!\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\int_0^1 \\left(\\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \n",
    "    \\right)^y dx = y!\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Latex documents have a very specific structure in terms of the sequence in which certain elements must appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The start of the document\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command is always `\\documentclass[]{}` defining the type of document (e.g., `article, book, report, letter`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you can set several options. For example, to set size of text to 10 points and the letter paper size: \n",
    "\n",
    "```latex\n",
    "\\documentclass[10pt,letterpaper]{article}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining packages\n",
    "\n",
    "After having declared the type of document, you can specify special packages you want to use. Some particularly useful ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "|||\n",
    "|:-|:-|\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{color}`| Use colors for text in your document|\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}`|Formats and commands for typesetting mathematical symbols and equations|\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{fancyhdr}`| Fine tune the formatting of headers and footers|\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{graphicx}`| Include figures in different formats: pdf, ps, eps, gif and jpeg|\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{listings}`| Typeset source code for different programming languages|\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{rotating}`| Allow rotation of tables and figures|\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{hyperref}`| Allow formatting of hyperlinks.\n",
    "|`\\usepackage{lineno}`| Allow line numbers|`_`| |\n",
    "|\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The main body\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you select the packages, you must start the main body of your document with `\\begin{document}` and end it with `\\end{document}`.\n"

    "    * At this step, bibtex takes the citation info in the aux file and puts the relevant biblogrphic entries into the `.bbl` file (you can take a peek at all these files), formatted according to the instructions provided by the bibliography style that you have specified using `bibliographystyle{plain}`.\n",
    "* The second `pdflatex` run updates `FirstExample.log` and `FirstExample.aux` (and a still-incomplete `.pdf` - the citations are not correctly formatted yet)\n",
    "     * At this step, the reference list in the `.bbl` generated in the above step is included in the document, and the correct labels for the in-text `cite{...}` commands are written in `.aux` file (but the non in the actual pdf).\n",
    "* The third and final `pdflatex` run then updates `FirstExample.log` and `FirstExample.aux` one last time, and now produces the complete `.pdf` file, with citations correctly formatted. \n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout all this, the `.log` file plays no role except to record info about how the commands are running. \n",
    "\n",
    "PHEW! Why go through this repetitive sequence of commands? Well, \"it is what it is\" &ndash; $\\LaTeX$, with all its advantages does have its quirks. The reason why it is this way, is probably that back then (Donald Knuth's PhD Thesis writing days &ndash; late 1950's to early 1960's), computers had *tiny* memories (RAMs), and writing files to disk and then reading them back in for the next step of the algorithm/program was the best (and only) way to go. Why has this not been fixed? I am not sure - keep an eye out, and it might well be (and then, raise an issue on TheMulQuaBio's [Github](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/issues)!)\n",
