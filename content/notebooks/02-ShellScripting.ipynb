    "Instead of typing all the UNIX commands we need to perform one after the other, we can save them all in a file (a \"script\") and execute them all at once. Recall from the [UNIX and Linux Chapter](./01-Unix.ipynb) that the bash shell (or terminal) is a text command processor that interfaces with the Operating System. The bash shell provides a computer language that can be used to build scripts (AKA shell scripts) that can be run through the terminal."

    "\n",
    "It is possible to write reasonably sophisticated programs with shell scripting, but the bash language is not featured to the extent that it can replace a \"proper\" language like C, Python, or R. However, you will find that shell scripting is necessary. This is because as such, as you saw in the previous chapter, UNIX has an incredibly powerful set of tools that can be used through the bash terminal. Shell scripts can allow you to automate the usage of these commands and create your own, simple utility tools/scripts/programs for tasks such as backups, converting file formats, handling & manipulating files and directories). This enables you to perform many everyday tasks on your computer without having to invoke another language that might require installation or updating.\n",

    "* By convention, Unix shell variables should be named in UPPERCASE\n",
    "* Also, to create more complex variable names, use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) (for example \"VAR_NAME\")\n",
    "* There should be no spaces around the `=` when assigning these variables; `MY_VAR=value` would work, but `MY_VAR = value`  wouldn't, because then the shell assumes that `MY_VAR` must be the name of a command and tries to execute it (with ` = value` as arguments).\n",

It can also can be written as `#!/bin/bash` (assuming you are using the bash shell). It tells the bash interpreter that this is a bash script and that it should be interpreted and run as such, and be executed by `/bin/sh`.\n",

    "*  The `-e` flag to `echo`\n",
    "* Note that there is a commented out `exit` command at the end of the script. Uncommenting it will not change the behavior of the script, but will allow you to generate a error code, and if the command is inserted in the middle of the script, to stop the code at that point.

    "* Along with the completeness of the practicals/exercises themselves, you will be marked on the basis of how complete and well-organized your directory structure and content is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review (especially if you got lost along the way) and make sure all the shell scripts you created in this chapter are functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you have your weekly directory organized with `data`, `sandbox`, `code` with the necessary files, under ` CMEECourseWork/week1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *All scripts should run on any other Unix/Linux machine* â€” for example, always call data from the `data` directory using relative paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure there is a `readme` file in every week's directory. This file should give an overview of the weekly directory contents, listing all the scripts and what they do. This is different from the `readme` for your overall git repository, of which `Week 1` is a part. You will write a similar ` readme` for each subsequent weekly submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't put any scripts that are part of the submission in your `home/bin` directory! You can put a copy there, but a working version should be in your repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that some of the shell scripts that you have created in this chapter above requires input files. For example, `tabtocsv.sh` needs one input file, and `ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh` needs two. When you run any of these scripts without inputs (e.g., just `bash tabtocsv.sh`), you either get no result, or an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal of this exercise is to make each such script robust so that it gives feedback to the user and exits if the right inputs are not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A new shell script\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a `csvtospace.sh` shell script that takes a `c`omma `s`eparated `v`alues and converts it to a space separated values file. However, it must not change the input file â€” it should save it as a differently named file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This script should be able to handle wrong or missing inputs (similar to the previous exercise). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Save the script in `CMEECourseWork/week1/code`, and run it on the `csv` data files that are in `Temperatures` in the master repository's `Data` directory.\n",
